# Introducing DayMark
I've decided to rename this app from Devo Tracker to DayMark. It's a simple change,
but it I believe that it better captures the reason behind this app and gives it a more unique identity.

# The Updates Page
I'm launching this Updates page so you can see what I'm building and what's changed. You'll find it on the top navigation bar.

I figured it would be a good idea to communication information about what's happening with the app.
Instead of wondering what's new or why something's changed, you can just check the Updates page anytime.
I'll post about new features, bug fixes, and improvements as they happen.

It's a simple way to stay connected without being overwhelmed. No need to subscribe to anything or check your email, it's just there when you want it.

# Why the Rebrand
When I first started building this tool, I called it Devo Tracker. It was a simple, boring name meant for a side project that I didn't plan spending a lot of time on. However, as I've spent more
and more time working on this project, I've thought more about where this app is going and decided it would be a good idea to have a unique branding that felt more accurate
to what this app is about: the daily practice, not just the tracking.

That's what it's really about, building a habit that sticks, one day at a time.

# What Comes Next
There are things I want to improve: better insights, better prayer management, more accountability features, etc.
You'll hear about all of it here on the Updates page as I work on it.

Thanks for using this little app I've built. Your feedback means a lot and I genuinely appreciate everyone that has and will give more thoughts to better this app.
Feel free to reach out with any questions, or even to just tell me that you enjoy the app. I can be reached via the feedback form or email at prince@prinke.dev.
